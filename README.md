# Hey Google... talk to Train Alarm!

Create reminder and get a notification when your train is approaching your destination station!

Train Alarm is an Indian train assistant. Tell your 'PNR Number' and you are all set. Be informed when your train is about to reach your destination station within a radius of 10 km to 35 km, so you'll never miss your stop.

## Getting Started

Just ask your Google Assistant: "*Talk to Train Alarm*" and follow through the instructions.
